:mod:`utilities` -- Collection of handy functions
*************************************************

A collection of classes and functions for a variety of purposes, which doesn't fit in one of the other modules. This combines ease-of-use classes for energy conversion and fine-structure level representation, a class for modeling a release curve, as well as functions for working with an ND-array of callable objects, a rounding function and a function to loop over all entry indexes in a multidimensional matrix.
