:mod:`polar` -- Polarization simulations
****************************************

Optical pumping simulations, meaning interaction between free atoms/ions and lasers can be performed using this module. Simulations are performed by generating a rate equation model, taking all given levels into account. Multi photon absorption is not included in the simulations.

.. warning:: The user interface created in the script `OpticalPumping.py` automates the input and information extraction for the :class:`Polar` object, which can get complicated. Use of this GUI is advised if quick simulations have to be run!
